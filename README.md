Responsive Mortgage Calculator
==============================

This is a bit of code that creates and processes a mortgage calculator. It functions with or without jQuery. Use it with my good will.

NOTE: There seems to be a bug JS bug that prevents the form from being resubmitted if only the payment period is changed...

* DISCLAIMER *

I do not vouch for the accuracy of this mortgage calculator and any results. It's pretty darn good, but the bank has the final say...

The calculator is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect actual numbers for your mortgage. 
Assumes constant interest rate throughout amortization period; interest calculated semi-annually.
